# 📡 Network Troubleshooting and Packet Analysis Lab

## 🧠 Objective
To capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark and develop an understanding of TCP/IP communications, protocols, and network troubleshooting techniques.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Wireshark**
- **TCP/IP Protocol Suite**
- **Windows/Linux OS (for packet generation)**
- **Command Line Tools:** `ping`, `tracert`/`traceroute`, `netstat`

---

## 📝 What I Did
- Captured live network traffic using Wireshark on a local machine
- Applied filters to isolate HTTP, DNS, TCP handshakes, and ICMP packets
- Analyzed:
  - TCP 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
  - HTTP GET/POST request structure
  - DNS query/response timing
  - ICMP echo requests (ping)
- Identified packet loss and high latency using `ping` and `tracert`
- Interpreted packet flags, TTL, port numbers, and MAC/IP addresses
- Documented findings and annotated packet flow in screenshots

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Learned to navigate and filter large packet datasets in Wireshark
- Understood how key protocols operate at different OSI layers
- Gained experience identifying latency, routing paths, and dropped packets
- Built foundational skills useful in network support and cybersecurity roles

---

## 🔄 Reflections & Next Steps
- Next time, I'll simulate a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack for deeper inspection
- Plan to explore Wireshark’s graphing and expert analysis tools
- Consider scripting repetitive packet analysis using `tshark`
